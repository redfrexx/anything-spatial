Hi there, 

I'm Christina - a PhD student in Geoinformation Science living in the beautiful city of Heidelberg in Germany. When I started my studies in environmental science, I really didn't expect spending most of my time in front of a computer, but now Python is my favourite tool for basically anything ... mainly for geospatial data analysis, but also for fun stuff like web development with Django Girls. To satisfy the old stereotype of an environmental scientst at least in part, I do love spending time outside hiking or mountainbiking and of course traveling whenever possible.
