Hi there, 

I'm Christina - a PhD student in Geoinformation Science living in the beautiful city of Heidelberg in Germany. When I started my studies in environmental science, I certaintly didn't expect ending up sitting in front of a computer most of the time, but now Python (and sometimes R) have become my favourite tools for basically anything ... mainly for geospatial data analysis, but also for fun stuff like web development with Django Girls. To satisfy the old stereotype of an environmental scientst at least in part, I do love spending time outside hiking or mountainbiking and of course traveling whenever possible.
